The aim of this project was to build an all-in-one place to explore your data very easily!

Currently, there are 5 features available, 

1. Data Profiling: It provides an overview of dataset, no of missing values, information on variables, correlation etc.

2. Missing Values: It shows the no of missing values in your dataset and provides you options on what you want to do with it. for eg, if you select fill with mean, it will fill the missing values with mean and provide you the option to download the updated csv file.

3. Visualization: Here, you can select the variables and the type of graph you want to see.

4. Anomaly Detection: It helps you to find outliers in the dataset.
